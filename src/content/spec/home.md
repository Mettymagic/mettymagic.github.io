# Welcome to the Mettyverse!
This serves as personal blog where I irregularly post long-form articles ranging from media analysis to personal experience reports on all sorts of different subjects - there's no better way to get your thoughts out there than to write 'em down.

Feel free to read posts below, [browse the archive](/archive/), [or read more about me.](/about/)
