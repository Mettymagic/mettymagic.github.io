*"What's the point in writing if nobody's ever going to see it?"*

This is something that I used to always tell myself - that if I'm going to do something, there needs to be purpose behind it. It needs to perform some kind of function and ultimately be productive in some sort of way in order to be worthy of my time. Even if there was a use for it, it then followed as to whether it was even good enough or not by my own standards or the standards of the goal it seeks to achieve. As indicated by the existence of this post, I'd argue that this is a frankly miserable mindset to live by and that this utilitarian mindset hurts more than it helps. Befitting of my first blog post, I figured I should rationalize the existence of this platform and the reasons I chose to create it - but first we're going to need to dive right into a bit of a personal loredrop.

### Expectations & Utilitarianism
Let me start by explaining what the notion of a "utilitarian mindset" actually entails. I'm sure it's not uncommon for people to feel - as I do - strongly bound by the expectations set on them. This is absolutely everywhere in my university for software engineering: so many people define their entire personality by their academic ability or work prospects. These priorities seem to come at the cost of everything else: hobbies, personality, individuality, etc. - but what would cause one to sacrifice these things? Ultimately, I believe it comes down to a sense of selflessness that manifests as people-pleasing in meeting social expectations or corporate usefulness. While I've discussed the latter in terms of my experience with school peers, I've struggled heavily with the former my entire life; I've always been an outsider desperately trying to fit in across friend circles and social cliques and I ended up learning that the only way I could be valued was through fitting the standards put on me by others. The rationality of these standards or if I personally agreed with them didn't matter; I just wanted to belong. Thus, my self-worth was determined entirely in maximizing the "value" I provide to others and I did everything I could to fit in. I've internalized this mindset as a core value and many ultimately stupid expectations continue to haunt me to this day.

Once I started properly accounting for the fact that I am a trans woman with ADHD and that these expectations are made for and by the social majority of which I am not, it becomes clear that this mindset is ultimately impossible to fulfil. More often than not these failings are interpreted as a personal failing no matter which angle I looked at it from: if I blame my disabilities, that's deflection and a failing in accountability. If I don't blame my disabilities, it's my personal choice and I am a bad person. Either way I feel a deep pit in my stomach and I'm drained of energy; if I try contributing towards the notion of productivity, I no longer have the capability to do so and blame myself, and if I don't then I blame myself for putting it off. 

That is all to say, it often feels like there is no winning when trying to meet these expectations, which culminates in a slurry of anxiety. Whether these expectations are unfair or not, the reality I face each and every day is that the demands of others outweighs my own. Neglecting these demands would result in severe social ostracization in my case - something which I have been constantly reminded of throughout my life. It is impossible for me to categorize whether these feelings are valid, and by extension the expectations brought upon me, or not, so I often find myself seeking validation that I'm not actually the awful person I've been conditioned to believe I am.

### The Point
Writing is, at its essence, an outlet and form for self-expression. As a very expressive person with not many outlets, I often turn towards fictional writing and immersing myself in worlds and characters of my own creation. This is where all the previous stuff about expectations comes in: I have a severe anxiety around sharing my writing and how it will be received by the few (if any) people that see it. I suck at opening up to people in general, especially directly and personally.

To answer the initial question of the article, I created this site as an outlet for me to facilitate these discussions that I would otherwise withhold. It's a way for me to express my feelings, grievances, and ideas with my friends without requiring a conversation I would never engage. I hope to use journal-style writing as a way to "test the waters", so to speak, with the people in my life and learn first-hand whether my fears are founded or not as there's no other way for me to convince myself. I want to be able to talk about my hobbies, my work, and my interests and my prior attempts in opening outlets have failed because they required two-way conversations that often just validated my own insecurities. So I figured: why not use a blogsite template to eliminate the need for that second person? If my friends read it and talk about it, cool. If other people find it somehow and take meaning or insight from the things I yap about, that's cool too. If nobody sees it, at least I got it out there and took a step outside my comfort zone.

### What to Expect
I've got a couple of different topics lined up that I'd like to publicize my thoughts on, ranging from nerdy rambling to personal experiences to writing philosophy. I'm not entirely sure how often I'm going to post or what I'm specifically going to share but I'm at the least going to let the people in my life know it exists.

I'll be interested to see where this all goes and I hope others may be as well.
